Explain that anxiety becomes problematic when it's disproportionate to the actual threat or interferes with daily functioning. Use relatable examples like feeling nervous before an exam (normal) vs. being unable to sleep for weeks due to health worries (excessive).</p>

                <p><strong>Sarah, 22, College Student:</strong></p>
                <p>"It started during finals week. I felt my heart racing while studying and immediately thought 'heart attack.' Even though I'm young and healthy, I couldn't shake the fear. I started checking my pulse constantly, researching heart conditions online, and visiting the campus health center weekly. The more I searched, the more convinced I became that something was seriously wrong. Sleep became impossible, and I couldn't concentrate on anything except my health fears."</p>

Emphasize that Sarah's initial heart racing was likely due to caffeine, stress, or lack of sleep - completely normal during finals. Point out how the internet search reinforced her fears rather than reassured her. Ask if anyone can relate to this pattern of escalation.</p>

                <p>Mention that experiencing some of these symptoms doesn't automatically mean someone has health anxiety - context and severity matter. However, if several symptoms persist and interfere with daily life, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare professional. Validate that these symptoms are real and distressing, not "all in their head."</p>

1. Make the Intro More Relatable

Start with a personal hook or rhetorical question:

> “Have you ever Googled a small headache and convinced yourself it’s something serious?”



Add a one-liner stat:

> “Studies show 1 in 10 people experience health anxiety today.”





---

2. Simplify Heavy Sections

Some slides (e.g., Types of Anxiety and Health Anxiety Details) are a bit text-heavy.

Replace long bullet lists with icons + short phrases.

Use one-sentence takeaways under visuals.



---

3. Include More Real-Life Micro-Examples

For every key concept, add a relatable “mini-story”:

Fight-or-flight response → “Imagine walking in the dark and hearing footsteps behind you…”

Checking behaviors → “Like checking your pulse 30 times a day.”


This makes the audience emotionally connect.


---

4. Add Audience Engagement Prompts

On 2–3 slides, add small questions:

“How many of you have searched symptoms online recently?”

“Have you ever felt relief after a normal test result… but started worrying again a week later?”



---

5. Visual Storytelling for the Anxiety Cycle

Instead of just a diagram:

Use simple language to narrate each stage:

> “Trigger → Thought → Anxiety → Checking → Relief → Repeat.”




You can even animate arrows if you want.


---

6. Strengthen Coping Mechanisms

Highlight one “quick win” technique per category:

Breathing → “Box breathing: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s.”

Thought reframing → “Instead of What if I have X, ask What if I’m okay?”


Add a visual CBT triangle with emotions, thoughts, and actions labeled in simpler, conversational terms.



---

7. End with Hope + Action

Close with an empowering note:

> “Health anxiety doesn’t define you. It’s just a chapter, not your whole story.”



Give three simple takeaways on the last slide:

1. Stop Googling every symptom.


2. Learn one calming technique.


3. Talk to someone you trust.

                <h4>Speaker Notes:</h4>
                <p>End on an encouraging note - emphasize that seeking information about mental health is already a positive step. Address common concerns: validate that it's normal to worry about health, but there's a difference between reasonable concern and debilitating anxiety. Recovery timeline varies but many people see improvement within weeks to months with proper support. Encourage questions and create a safe space for sharing. Remind everyone that resources are available and that taking care of mental health is just as important as physical health.</p>

1. Make the Intro More Relatable

Start with a personal hook or rhetorical question:

> “Have you ever Googled a small headache and convinced yourself it’s something serious?”



Add a one-liner stat:

> “Studies show 1 in 10 people experience health anxiety today.”





---

2. Simplify Heavy Sections

Some slides (e.g., Types of Anxiety and Health Anxiety Details) are a bit text-heavy.

Replace long bullet lists with icons + short phrases.

Use one-sentence takeaways under visuals.



---

3. Include More Real-Life Micro-Examples

For every key concept, add a relatable “mini-story”:

Fight-or-flight response → “Imagine walking in the dark and hearing footsteps behind you…”

Checking behaviors → “Like checking your pulse 30 times a day.”


This makes the audience emotionally connect.


---

4. Add Audience Engagement Prompts

On 2–3 slides, add small questions:

“How many of you have searched symptoms online recently?”

“Have you ever felt relief after a normal test result… but started worrying again a week later?”



---

5. Visual Storytelling for the Anxiety Cycle

Instead of just a diagram:

Use simple language to narrate each stage:

> “Trigger → Thought → Anxiety → Checking → Relief → Repeat.”




You can even animate arrows if you want.


---

6. Strengthen Coping Mechanisms

Highlight one “quick win” technique per category:

Breathing → “Box breathing: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s.”

Thought reframing → “Instead of What if I have X, ask What if I’m okay?”


Add a visual CBT triangle with emotions, thoughts, and actions labeled in simpler, conversational terms.



---

7. End with Hope + Action

Close with an empowering note:

> “Health anxiety doesn’t define you. It’s just a chapter, not your whole story.”



Give three simple takeaways on the last slide:

1. Stop Googling every symptom.


2. Learn one calming technique.


3. Talk to someone you trust.
